The project will have a new strategy line: I will change base tools:
front-end: react.js - a more flexible tool instead of native JS.
backend: Django  - this tool has completed modules DRF, ORM

It will generate Django application modules.

Python development tool - Backend (Python-FastAPI) + Frontend (JS-HTML-CSS), for describing common real-world objects as a database model with minimal programming.

First look at new interface
Left side  - my clear JS-interface
Right side - original 1C enterprise interface that inspired me to work
